# Pip Pip and Tally-Ho My Dear GitHub

This is a README.md file that will be used to describe this 
repository on GitHub.

This is an extra line of text added to the copy 
of README.md in the cloned repository.

Oh no it isn't. This is an extra line of text added to the 
README.md in the original repository after pulling from 
the clone.

BUT WAIT! There's more. This is an additional paragraph 
marking, and entirely encompassing, the new features 
included in the development of the new-feature branch.

This paragraph tests whether the Travis CI script runs 
as expected.
